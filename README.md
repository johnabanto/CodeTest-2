This project we had to complete a code test to see how much we have learned so far in the cohort. The questions were based on what we learned up this point from Javascript, JQuery and AngularJS. I created an HTML front to view the code that I created for each question as well has numbered and wrote the question for reference. I enjoyed the code test to go back and use what we learned and challenge myself to complete each task.
